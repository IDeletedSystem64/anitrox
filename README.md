# Anitrox
Your new favorite bot!

## Get started!
To get started, You'll need Node.JS and NPM

You can get these through either your Linux distributions package manager, or if you are on Windows, by [clicking here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install those dependencies!

Run ``npm install`` and wait for it to download dependencies

## Configure yo bot!

Get or make your Discord bot token from [The Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and rename ``.env.example`` to ``.env``. Set the ``TOKEN=""`` to the token you got from Discord 

Then grab your Discord User ID and put it in ``OWNERID=""``, This tells the bot who owns it 

⚠️ **WARNING**: This gives access to the bots controls, such as restart/shutdown, and eval! Make sure you use your own ID and not somebody elses.

## Get this party started! 

Run ``npm start`` to start the bot!
